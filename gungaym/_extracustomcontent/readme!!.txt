This shit contains a few custom thingies as well as their assets. Included is...
*Dildo launcher
*Mas Fuego shotgun
*PPSH
*CZ-75 (probably removing soon)
*Revolver
*Grenade launcher that shouts "onii chan"
*Some custom battle chatter sounds from CoD:WaW

This should give you a good idea of how to make your own custom shit, just drop the assets like materials and sound in their respective folders and put the new gamemode/entity stuff over the base gamemode/entity stuff, ask me on steam if you have any more questions
