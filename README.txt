Put the gungaym folder in garrysmod/gamemodes/
Put the tool in garrysmod/addons/ if you want to arm your own maps (look up how the TTT arming tool works, same deal)

NOTE: Players don't have to download the map text files, but they'll need the scope material (sounds are somewhat optional, you'll still be able to play w/o them)
